  - Added a Quick Buy Button to the production screen!
- update: Border Toggles
  - added localizations and compability

  - No longer overrides any core game files directly
  - Encapsulates button logic with a Component
- update: Policy Yield Preview
  - Show yields even if their value is exactly zero. This way it should be easier to identify not implemented policies and/or policies with bugs
  - Add a configuration option (after you load a savegame, go in the Options > Game menu, you'll find it at the bottom) to enable Colorful yield previews based on yield type (screenshot attached). You can now choose the preferred display mode; I'd like to work on list display for the policies next, and keep it configurable.

    - Developer note: This will be one of the optional things when I implement customization in the future, I think it looks much better like this.
  - Replace relationship icons with circular icons (mostly inspired by Civilization VI emoji's). They are also now part of the leader portrait.
    - Developer note: I ... hate the original Civ 7 icons - some of them are circular, some of them are triangles, they are not consistent at all. I prefer the Civilization VI look with emojis, so I created these new icons with Canva. I would love to hear your feedback.
  - Re-designed war support count banner
    - I also did not like how this was standing under the war icon - now it has a dedicated place on the portrait of the leader (like the relationship symbol on the left side).
  - Restore proper hovering animations for leader portraits, and animations when their turn is active
  - Add identity to the Civilization banners - we have a banner strip (with the color of the player) visible with the Civilization symbol inside.
    - I know this increases the space the banners take, but I feel like the banners were lacking their own "identity" and you could not understand which player was for example next to you and so on (I also received feedback about this). I will definitely making this customizable, so people can choose to toggle it off, if they want to.
  - Add new user customization options
    - You can now choose if you want to hide the banner with the Civilization symbol (by default it will be enabled)
    - You can now choose if you want to always display all yields, without having to hover over to see them (by default the additional yields will still only show on hover)

  - Also adds a toggle so that untradeable cities are still included in the initial sort, meaning you dont have to scroll all way the down to see the best ones if you needed to Improve Trade Relations.
